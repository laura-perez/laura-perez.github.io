<H2>Fuel System Description</H2>


<A NAME="ss1-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss1-2221840">
<H3>Fuel System Overview</H3></A><p>The fuel system is a returnless on-demand design. The fuel pressure regulator is a part of the fuel pump module, eliminating the need for a return pipe from the engine. A returnless fuel system reduces the internal temperature of the fuel tank by not returning
hot fuel from the engine to the fuel tank. Reducing the internal temperature of the fuel tank results in lower evaporative emissions. </p>
<p>An electric turbine- style fuel pump is attached to the fuel pump module inside the fuel tank. The fuel pump supplies high pressure fuel through the fuel feed pipe to the fuel injection system. The fuel pump provides fuel at a higher rate of flow
than is needed by the fuel injection system. The fuel pressure regulator, a part of the fuel pump module, maintains the correct fuel pressure to the fuel injection system. The fuel pump module contains a reverse flow check valve. The check valve and the fuel
pressure regulator maintain fuel pressure in the fuel feed pipe and the fuel rail in order to prevent long cranking times. </p>

<A NAME="ss2-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss2-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Tank</H3></A><p>The fuel tank stores the fuel supply. The fuel tank is located in the rear of the vehicle. The fuel tank is held in place by 2 metal straps that are attached to the underbody. The fuel tank is molded from high-density polyethylene. </p>

<A NAME="ss3-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss3-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Filler Cap</H3></A>
<p><font color=brown><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If a fuel tank filler cap requires replacement, use only a fuel tank filler cap with the same features. Failure to use the correct fuel tank filler cap can result in a serious malfunction of the fuel and Evaporative Emission (EVAP)
system.
</font></p><p>The fuel fill pipe has a tethered fuel filler cap. A torque-limiting device prevents the cap from being overtightened. To install the cap, turn the cap clockwise until the cap clicks audibly. This indicates that the cap is correctly torqued and fully seated.
A fuel filler cap that is not fully seated may cause a malfunction in the emission system. </p>

<A NAME="ss4-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss4-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Pump Module</H3></A><p>The fuel pump module consists of the following major components: </p>

<div align="left"><TABLE CELLSPACING="0"  border="0"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">The fuel filter </td></tr></table></div>


<A NAME="ss5-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss5-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Level Sensor</H3></A><p>The fuel level sensor consists of a float, a wire float arm, and a ceramic resistor card. The position of the float arm indicates the fuel level. The fuel level sensor contains a variable resistor which changes resistance in correspondence with the position
of the float arm. The ECM sends the fuel level information via the serial data circuit to the instrument panel cluster. This information is used for the instrument panel cluster fuel gauge and the low fuel warning indicator, if applicable. The ECM also monitors
the fuel level input for various diagnostics. </p>

<A NAME="ss6-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss6-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Pump</H3></A><p>The fuel pump is mounted in the fuel pump module reservoir. The fuel pump is an electric high-pressure pump. Fuel is pumped to the fuel injection system at specified rates of flow and pressure. The fuel pump delivers a constant flow of fuel to the engine
even during low fuel conditions and aggressive vehicle maneuvers. The ECM controls the electric fuel pump operation through a fuel pump relay. The fuel pump flex pipe acts to dampen the fuel pulses and noise generated by the fuel pump. </p>

<A NAME="ss7-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss7-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Strainer</H3></A><p>The fuel strainer is attached to the lower end of the fuel pump module. The fuel strainer is made of woven plastic. The functions of the fuel strainer are to filter contaminants and to wick away fuel. Normally, the fuel strainer does not require maintenance.
Fuel stoppage at this point indicates that the fuel tank contains an abnormal amount of sediment or contamination.</p>

<A NAME="ss8-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss8-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Pressure Regulator</H3></A><p>The fuel pressure regulator is contained in the fuel pump module near the fuel pump outlet. The fuel pressure regulator is a diaphragm relief valve. The diaphragm has fuel pressure on one side and regulator spring pressure on the other side.
The fuel pressure regulator is not vacuum biased. Fuel pressure is controlled by a pressure balance across the regulator. The fuel system pressure is constant. </p>

<A NAME="ss9-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss9-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Feed Pipes</H3></A><p>The fuel feed pipe carries fuel from the fuel tank to the fuel injection system. The fuel pipe consists of 3 sections: </p>

<div align="left"><TABLE CELLSPACING="0"  border="0"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">The rear fuel pump fuel feed hose runs from the top of the fuel tank to the chassis fuel pipe. The rear fuel hose is constructed of nylon. </td></tr></table></div>

<H3>Nylon Fuel Pipes</H3></A>
<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>Warning: </B></FONT>Refer to <a href="92063597.en.html"><FONT COLOR=RED>Fuel and Evaporative Emission Pipe Warning</FONT></A> in the Preface section.</P><p>Nylon pipes are constructed to withstand maximum fuel system pressure, exposure to fuel additives, and changes in temperature. </p>
<p>Heat resistant rubber hose or corrugated plastic conduit protect the sections of the pipes that are exposed to chafing, high temperature, or vibration. </p>
<p>Nylon fuel pipes are somewhat flexible and can be shaped around gradual turns under the vehicle. However, if nylon fuel pipes are forced into sharp bends, the pipes may kink and restrict the flow of fuel. Also, once exposed to fuel, nylon pipes may become
stiffer and are more likely to kink if bent too far. Exercise special care when working on a vehicle with nylon fuel pipes.</p>

<A NAME="ss12-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss12-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Pulse Dampener</H3></A><p>The fuel pulse dampener is a part of the front fuel pump fuel feed hose. The fuel pulse dampener is diaphragm-operated with fuel pump pressure on one side and with spring pressure on the other side. The function of the dampener is to dampen the fuel pump
pressure pulsations. </p>

<A NAME="ss13-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss13-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Rail Assembly</H3></A><p>The fuel rail assembly is attached to the cylinder head. The fuel rail assembly performs the following functions: </p>

<div align="left"><TABLE CELLSPACING="0"  border="0"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">Positions the injectors in the intake ports of the cylinder head </td></tr></table></div>
<div align="left"><TABLE CELLSPACING="0"  border="0"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">Distributes fuel evenly to the injectors </td></tr></table></div>


<A NAME="ss14-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss14-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Injectors</H3></A><p>The fuel injector assembly is a solenoid device controlled by the ECM that meters pressurized fuel to a single engine cylinder. The ECM energizes the high-impedance, 12&nbsp;&#8486;, injector solenoid to open a ball valve, normally closed. This allows
fuel to flow into the top of the injector, past the ball valve, and through a director plate at the injector outlet. The director plate has machined holes that control the flow of fuel, generating a spray of finely atomized fuel at the injector tip. Fuel from
the injector tip is directed at the intake valve, causing the fuel to become further atomized and vaporized before entering the combustion chamber. This fine atomization improves fuel economy and emissions. The fuel pressure regulator compensates for engine
load by increasing fuel pressure as the engine vacuum drops. </p>

<A NAME="ss15-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss15-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Metering Modes of Operation</H3></A><p>The ECM monitors voltages from several sensors in order to determine how much fuel to feed to the engine. The ECM controls the amount of fuel delivered to the engine by changing the fuel injector pulse width. The fuel is delivered under one of several
modes. </p>

<A NAME="ss16-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss16-2221840">
<H3>Starting Mode</H3></A><p>When the ECM detects reference pulses from the crankshaft position sensor, the ECM will enable the fuel pump. The fuel pump runs and builds up pressure in the fuel system. The ECM then monitors the manifold absolute pressure (MAP), intake air temperature
(IAT), engine coolant temperature (ECT), and accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor signals in order to determine the required injector pulse width for starting. </p>

<A NAME="ss17-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss17-2221840">
<H3>Clear Flood Mode</H3></A><p>If the engine is flooded with fuel during starting and will not start, the clear flood mode can be manually enabled. To enable Clear Flood Mode, press the accelerator to wide open throttle (WOT). The ECM will completely turn OFF the fuel injectors and
will maintain this mode as long as the ECM detects a WOT condition with engine speed below a predetermined value. </p>

<A NAME="ss18-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss18-2221840">
<H3>Run Mode</H3></A><p>The run mode has 2 conditions referred to as open loop and closed loop. When the engine is first started and the engine speed is above a predetermined RPM, the system begins open loop operation. The ECM ignores the signal from the heated oxygen sensor
(HO2S). The engine ECM calculates the air/fuel ratio based on inputs from the engine coolant temperature (ECT), the manifold absolute pressure (MAP), and accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor. The system stays in open loop until meeting the following conditions:</p>

<div align="left"><TABLE CELLSPACING="0"  border="0"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">The heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) has varying voltage output, showing that the heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) is hot enough to operate properly. </td></tr></table></div>
<div align="left"><TABLE CELLSPACING="0"  border="0"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">The ECT sensor is above a specified temperature. </td></tr></table></div>
<div align="left"><TABLE CELLSPACING="0"  border="0"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">A specific amount of time has elapsed after starting the engine. </td></tr></table></div>

<p>Specific values for the above conditions exist for each different engine, and are stored in the programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), which may be erased electrically. The system begins closed loop operation after reaching these values. In closed loop,
the ECM calculates the air/fuel ratio, injector ON time, based upon the signal from various sensors, but mainly from the heated oxygen sensor (HO2S). This allows the air/fuel ratio to stay very close to 14.7:1. </p>

<A NAME="ss19-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss19-2221840">
<H3>Acceleration Mode</H3></A><p>The ECM monitors the changes in the accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor. and the manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor signal in order to determine when the vehicle is being accelerated. The ECM will then increase the injector pulse width in order
to provide more fuel for increased performance. </p>

<A NAME="ss20-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss20-2221840">
<H3>Deceleration Mode</H3></A><p>The ECM monitors changes in accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor and manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor signals to determine when the vehicle is being decelerated. The ECM will then decrease injector pulse width or even turn OFF injectors for short
periods to reduce exhaust emissions, and for better (engine braking) deceleration. </p>

<A NAME="ss21-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss21-2221840">
<H3>Battery Voltage Correction Mode</H3></A><p>When the battery voltage is low, the ECM compensates for the weak spark delivered by the ignition system in the following ways: </p>

<A NAME="ss22-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss22-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Cutoff Mode</H3></A><p>The ECM cuts OFF fuel from the fuel injectors when the following conditions are met in order to protect the powertrain from damage and improve driveability:</p>

<A NAME="ss23-2221840">
<A HREF="#ss23-2221840">
<H3>Fuel Trim</H3></A><p>The ECM controls the air/fuel metering system in order to provide the best possible combination of driveability, fuel economy, and emission control. The ECM monitors the heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) signal voltage while in closed loop and regulates the
fuel delivery by adjusting the pulse width of the injectors based on this signal. The ideal fuel trim values are around 0% for both short and long term fuel trim. A positive fuel trim value indicates the ECM is adding fuel in order to compensate for a lean condition
by increasing the pulse width. A negative fuel trim value indicates that the ECM is reducing the amount of fuel in order to compensate for a rich condition by decreasing the pulse width. A change made to the fuel delivery changes the long and short term fuel
trim values. The short term fuel trim values change rapidly in response to the heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) signal voltage. These changes fine-tune the engine fueling. The long term fuel trim makes rough adjustments to fueling in order to recenter and
restore control to short term fuel trim. A scan tool can be used to monitor the short and long term fuel trim values. The long term fuel trim diagnostic is based on an average of several of the long term speed load learn cells. The ECM selects the cells based
on the engine speed and engine load. If the ECM detects an excessively lean or rich condition, the ECM will set a fuel trim diagnostic trouble code (DTC). </p>
