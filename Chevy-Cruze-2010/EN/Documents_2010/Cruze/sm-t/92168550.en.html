<BR><IMG src="../../../../graphic-pool/6/86/8/68681.png" alt="6">
<BR><p>The supplemental inflatable restraint (SIR) system supplements the protection offered by the occupants Seat Belt System (2). The SIR system may contain several inflator modules located throughout the vehicle, i.e. steering wheel module (1), instrument
panel (I/P) module (1), or roof rail modules. In addition to inflator modules, the vehicle may contain seat belt pretensioners that tighten the seat belt in the event of a collision, thus reducing the distance between the occupant and the seat belt when an inflator
module is deployed. Each inflator module has a deployment loop that is controlled by the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) mounted inside the vehicle. The SDM determines the severity of a collision with the assistance of various sensor inputs located at strategic
points on the vehicle. When the SDM detects a collision, it will process the information provided by the sensors to further support air bag or pretensioner deployment. The SDM will deploy the frontal air bags and pretensioners if it detects a collision of sufficient
force. If the force of the impact is not sufficient to warrant inflator module deployment, the SDM may still deploy the seat belt pretensioners. The SDM performs continuous diagnostic monitoring of the SIR system electrical components. Upon detection of a circuit
malfunction, the SDM will set a DTC and inform the driver by illuminating the AIR BAG indicator. The steering column (1) and knee bolsters (3) are designed to absorb energy and compress during frontal collisions in order to limit leg movement and decrease the
chance of injury to the driver and passenger.</p>

<p>A frontal collision of sufficient force will deploy the frontal air bags and/or pretensioners. The sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) contains a sensing device that converts vehicle velocity changes to an electrical signal. The SDM compares these signals
to values stored in memory. If the signals exceed a stored value, the SDM will determine the severity of the impact and either cause current to flow through the frontal deployment loops deploying the frontal air bags and pretensioners, or it will deploy the
pretensioners only. The SDM, I/P module, steering wheel module, steering wheel module coil, seat belt retractor pretensioners, and the connecting wires make up the frontal deployment loops. The SDM continuously monitors the deployment loops for malfunctions
and illuminates the AIR BAG indicator if a fault is detected.</p>

<A HREF="#ss3-2168550">
<H3>Inflatable Restraint Sensing and Diagnostic Module (SDM)</H3></A><p>The sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) is a microprocessor and the control center for the supplemental inflatable restraint (SIR) system. The SDM contains internal sensors along with several external sensors, if equipped, mounted at strategic locations
on the vehicle. In the event of a collision, the SDM compares the signals from the internal and external sensors to a value stored in memory. When the generated signals exceed the stored value, the SDM will cause current to flow through the appropriate deployment
loops to deploy the air bags. The SDM records the SIR system status when a deployment occurs and illuminates the AIR BAG indicator located in the IPC. The SDM performs continuous diagnostic monitoring of the SIR system electrical components and circuitry when
the ignition is turned ON. If the SDM detects a malfunction, a DTC will be stored and the SDM will request the IPC to illuminate the AIR BAG indicator, notifying the driver that a malfunction exists. In the event that ignition positive voltage is lost during
a collision, the SDM maintains a 23-volt loop reserve (23&nbsp;VLR) for deployment of the air bags. It is important when disabling the SIR system for servicing or rescue operations to allow the 23&nbsp;VLR to dissipate, which could take up to 1&nbsp;minute.</p>

<H3>Inflatable Restraint Passenger Presence System</H3></A>
<p><font color=brown><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The passenger presence system (PPS), heated seat element (if equipped), and the seat bottom foam cushion is a calibrated unit and cannot be service separately. After repairing or replacing the PPS, the system must be recalibrated
in order to function properly.
</font></p><p>The PPS is used to monitor the weight of an occupant on the front outboard passenger seat and communicate the status to the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) whether to enable or suppress the deployment of the instrument panel (I/P) inflator module.
The PPS consist of an electronic control module, sensor mat, heated seat element (if equipped), wiring harness, and PASSENGER AIR BAG ON/OFF indicators. The sensor is made up of several flexible conductive metal strips placed underneath the seat cushion trim.
These sensor strips transmit and receive a low-level electric field. The weight of the occupant sitting in the front passenger seat is measured as a change in current flow within the sensor mat. If the sensor determines that the occupant weight is less than
a specified value, the PPS module will send a suppress signal to the SDM to disable the I/P module. If the sensor determines the occupant weight is higher than a specified value, the PPS module will send an enable signal to the SDM to enable the I/P. The PPS
module will notify the customer of the enable/disable status by illuminating one of the PASSENGER AIR BAG ON/OFF indicators located in the center of the instrument panel cluster (IPC). The PPS will also notify the SDM of a fault and the SDM will request the
IPC to illuminate the AIR BAG indicator located on the IPC.</p>

<H3>AIR BAG Indicator</H3></A><p>The AIR BAG indicator, located in the instrument panel cluster (IPC) and is used to notify the driver of SIR system malfunctions and to verify that the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) is communicating with the IPC. When the ignition is turned ON, the
SDM is supplied with ignition positive voltage. The SDM requests the IPC to flash the AIR BAG indicator seven times. While flashing the indicator, the SDM conducts tests on all SIR system components and circuits. If no malfunctions are detected the SDM will
communicate with the IPC through the serial data circuit and command the AIR BAG indicator OFF. The SDM provides continuous monitoring of the air bag circuits by conducting a sequence of checks. If a malfunction is detected the SDM will store a diagnostic trouble
code (DTC) and command the IPC to illuminate the AIR BAG indicator via serial data. The presence of a SIR system malfunction could result in non-deployment of the air bags or deployment in conditions less severe than intended. The AIR BAG indicator will remain
ON until the malfunction has been repaired.</p>

<H3>Dual Stage Inflator Modules</H3></A><p>Dual stage inflator modules contain a housing, inflatable air bag, two initiating devices, canister of gas generating material and, in some cases, stored compressed gas. The two initiators are part of the frontal deployment loop. The function of the frontal
deployment loops are to supply current through the steering wheel and instrument panel (I/P) inflator modules to deploy the air bags. The inflator modules have two stages of deployment, which varies the amount of restraint to the occupant according to the collision
severity. For moderate frontal collisions the inflator modules deploy at less than full deployment (low deployment) which consists of stage&nbsp;1 of the inflator module. For more severe frontal collisions a full deployment is initiated which consists of stage&nbsp;1
and stage&nbsp;2 of the inflator module. The current passing through the initiators ignites the material in the canister producing a rapid generation of gas and is some cases, the release of compressed gas. The gas produced from this reaction rapidly inflates
the air bag. Once the air bag is inflated it quickly deflates through the air bag vent holes and/or the bag fabric.</p>
<p>Each dual stage inflator modules is equipped with a shorting bar located in the connectors of the module. The shorting bar shorts the inflator module deployment loop circuitry to prevent unwanted deployment of the air bag when it is disconnected.</p>

The initiator is part of the seat belt pretensioner deployment loop. When the vehicle is
involved in a collision of sufficient force, the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) causes current to flow through the seat belt deployment loops to the initiator. Current passing through the initiator ignites the material in the canister producing a rapid
generation of gas. The gas produced from this reaction deploys the seat belt pretensioners and retracts the seat belt webbing, which removes all of the slack in the seat belts. Depending on the severity of the collision, the seat belt pretensioners may deploy
without the frontal inflator modules deploying, or they will deploy immediately before the frontal inflator modules deploy. Each seat belt pretensioner is equipped with a shorting bar that is located in the connector of the seat belt pretensioner. The shorting
bar shorts the seat belt pretensioner circuitry to prevent unwanted deployment of the seat belt pretensioner when the connector is disconnected.</p>

The steering wheel module coil consists of two or more current-carrying coils. The coils allow the rotation of the steering wheel while maintaining
continuous electrical contact between the driver deployment loop and the steering wheel module. Two or four, if equipped with dual stage air bags, coil wires are used for the steering wheel module deployment loop. Additional coil wires are used for accessories
attached to the steering wheel depending on the vehicle model. The steering wheel module coil connector is located near the base of the steering column. The connector contains a shorting bar that shorts the steering wheel module coil deployment loop circuitry
